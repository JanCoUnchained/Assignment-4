This document is for ideas & questions. 
The code below has one change to the model call which is an intercept 
before diagnosis. Malte has this in his model (& I think it is generally implicit in the lme4). However, I cannot tell from the output that this is any different from when we do not include it. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
mod_b <- bf("pitchSDLOGz ~ 1 + diagnosis + (1|studynr) + (1 | ID) + (1|trial)")

brm_b <- brm(
  mod_f, 
  prior = c(
    prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = "Intercept"),
    prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = "sd"), #Rhat = 1.01, could be more regularizing.
    prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = "b"),
    prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = "sigma")),
  data = pitch3, 
  cores = 4, iter = 4000, warmup = 2000,
  sample_prior = TRUE #added for later use. 
)

# model estimates 
brm_b #could be improved (when is it hacking?..) 

```
